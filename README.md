============

This is a mod I've been working on in my spare time - it's not anywhere near finished, and probably never will be, so I
figured I'd put the source up as a resource for other modders. Feel free to browse the code and learn what you can, but be
warned that there are no guarantees as to the completeness, efficiency or even correctness of any part contained herein.

This is intended as a resource for sharing ideas of how to accomplish certain tasks in modding, so you have my permission
to create similar classes / methods.

That being said, the ideas in this mod are my own, and while not necessarily unique, I do not give you permission to use
the code as is for your own mod. Please don't just copy / paste my code and call it your own. Thanks for your cooperation.

So in the spirit of community, I offer up my code as a reference and ask that you respect the intended use.

Good luck modding,
